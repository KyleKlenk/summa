SUMMA (Clark et al., [2015a](#clark_2015a);[b](#clark_2015b);[c](#clark_2015c); [2021](#clark_2021) is a hydrologic modeling framework that can be used for the systematic analysis of alternative model conceptualizations with respect to flux parameterizations, spatial configurations, and numerical solution techniques. It can be used to configure a wide range of hydrological model alternatives and we anticipate that systematic model analysis will help researchers and practitioners understand reasons for inter-model differences in model behavior. When applied across a large sample of catchments, SUMMA may provide insights in the dominance of different physical processes and regional variability in the suitability of different modeling approaches. An important application of SUMMA is selecting specific physics options to reproduce the behavior of existing models – these applications of "**model mimicry**" can be used to define reference (benchmark) cases in structured model comparison experiments, and can help diagnose weaknesses of individual models in different hydroclimatic regimes.

SUMMA is built on a common set of conservation equations and a common numerical solver, which together constitute the  “**structural core**” of the model. Different modeling approaches can then be implemented within the structural core, enabling a controlled and systematic analysis of alternative modeling options, and providing insight for future model development.

The important modeling features are:

 1. The formulation of the conservation model equations is cleanly separated from their numerical solution;

 2. Different model representations of physical processes (in particular, different flux parameterizations) can be used within a common set of conservation equations; and

 3. The physical processes can be organized in different spatial configurations, including model elements of different shape and connectivity (e.g., nested multi-scale grids and HRUs).


## Documentation
SUMMA documentation is available [online](http://summa.readthedocs.io/) and remains a work in progress. Additional SUMMA information including publications, test data sets, and sample applications can be found on the [SUMMA web site](http://www.ral.ucar.edu/projects/summa) at NCAR.

## Developer Guidelines for Contributing New Modular Components
New modular components may be added by using similar existing modular components as a template. The following steps (if applicable) may be used as a guideline. This process is illustrated using the addition of a new surface hydrology flux parameterization as an example.
1. Identify a similar model component
    * Identify the appropriate subdirectory within SUMMA's `source` directory such as:
        * `driver`: high-level program operations including the main driver
        * `dshare`: modules related to data storage and access
        * `engine`: low-level operations for physical and numerical processes
            * e.g., applies to flux calculations
    * Identify the appropriate source file and module
        * source files have self-explanatory names
            * e.g., `soilLiqFlx.f90` corresponds to operations for liquid water fluxes in soil
        * each source file generally contains one module
            * e.g., `soilLiqFlx.f90` contains `soilLiqFlx_module`
    * Identify the appropriate procedure
        * isolate the module procedure
            * e.g., within `soilLiqFlx_module`, the `surfaceFlx` module subroutine handles operations for surface hydrology fluxes
        * isolate the internal procedure
            * e.g., within the `contains` block of `surfaceFlx`, we have `update_surfaceFlx_prescribedHead` containing operations for specifying a prescirbed pressure head surface boundary condition
            * `update_surfaceFlx_prescribedHead` may be used as a template for our example contribution
        * note that procedure names in SUMMA are organized using the terms *initialize*, *update*, and *finalize* to categorize operation types
            * *initialize* procedures are used for initial setup steps (initialization of variables, memory allocation, etc.)
            * *update* procedures are used for major computational operations (e.g., flux calculations)
            * *finalize* procedures are for post-processing and final error control checks
2. Determine input and output variables
    * Found by examining dummy variables in argument lists
        * Note that internal procedures inherit the dummy variables from the applicable module procedure by default
        * e.g., for the `update_surfaceFlx_prescribedHead` internal subroutine, the argument list of the `surfaceFlx` module subroutine applies: `subroutine surfaceFlx(io_soilLiqFlx,in_surfaceFlx,io_surfaceFlx,out_surfaceFlx)`
    * Dummy variables may be objects with multiple data and procedure components
        * Such objects are declared using derived types (most commonly defined in `data_types.f90`)
        * Objects may be used to concisely interface data between the procedure and the caller
        * for SUMMA objects, the nomenclature `in_foobar`, `io_foobar`, and `out_foobar` is used for objects that interface input, input-output, and output data between the `foobar` procedure and its caller, respectively
    * The `intent` attribute within dummy variable declarations indicates usage for input, input-output, or output
        * e.g., within `surfaceFlx` we have `type(in_type_surfaceFlx) ,intent(in)    :: in_surfaceFlx`, indicating the `in_surfaceFlx` object is for input data only
        * as noted above, the `in_surfaceFlx` object interfaces input data between the `surfaceFlx` module subroutine and its caller (the `soilLiqFlx` module subroutine)
3. Create a skeleton of the new procedure
    * Choose a self explanatory name for the new procedure
        * e.g. `update_surfaceFlx_example_flux`
    * e.g., at the conclusion of this step, we would have a skeleton within the `contains` block of `surfaceFlx` similar to the following:


    ````fortran
    subroutine update_surfaceFlx_example_flux
    ! main computations for the calculation of an example flux
    
    end subroutine update_surfaceFlx_example_flux
    ````

    * For new module procedures, the argument list from the template routine should be adjusted to match the needs of the new procedure
    * For internal procedures (such as the example above), adding new data to interface objects from the corresponding module procedure may be required (see next step)
4. Update derived type definitions for interface objects
    * It may be desirable to add data components to existing objects related to the template procedure
        * e.g., adding a new numerical constant to be used in calculating a surface hydrology flux would require interfacing that data to the `update_surfaceFlx_example_flux` subroutine, which can be done using the `in_surfaceFlx` object
5. Add operations to the skeleton procedure
6. Update model decisions (if necessary)
